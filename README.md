## Technologies
Before analyzing the text directly, preprocessing with NLTK was performed. Namely, lemmatization, stemming, stop word removal and tokenization. Embeddings were also created using Word2Vec.

A dictionary approach, specifically VaderSentiment, was chosen to determine the tone of the text.
